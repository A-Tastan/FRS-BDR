% OUTPUTS:
%       W_block_hat     :(numeric) zero diagonal block affinity matrix of
%                         size (N-N_{o_I}) x (N-N_{o_I}) if Type I outlier
%                         removal has been preferred in Step 1.1.
%                         (N x N otherwise)
%       v_dddot_hat     :(numeric) the vector v estimate of size 
%                        (N-N_{I}) x 1 if Type I outlier removal has been
%                         preferred in Step 1.1. (N x 1 otherwise)
%       W_sim_hat       :(numeric) similarity coefficients matrix of size
%                         K_hat x K_hat. It contains similarity coefficients that
%                         the blocks are concentrated around.
%       bsize_vec_hat   :(numeric) estimated block size vector of size
%                         K_hat x 1
%       error           :(numeric) estimation error associated to K_hat
